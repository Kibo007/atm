# ATM simulator

I imagine this solution of ATM simulator combined from 4 main components. I used for data layer redux and for
ui layer angular. First idea was also to finish it in angular for UI and than also write react implementation.
Since data layer stay same that should not be big problem. But due time limitation I this time didn't write ui
layer angular and react, just angular.

I also would like to do here unit test for data layer and to add build for production. I didn't use angular
router here since didn't see need for this case.

I also think would be nice to implement more animation to make all process much smother and realistic.

## From technology point I used here next frameworks and libraries:
 - Angular
 - Redux
 - Webpack
 - ES6
 - Sass

to be able to run this project just do `NPM install` to install dependencies
after that start project with `npm run start`

for best expirience use chrome browser, I use this node v5.10.1 and npm 3.2.1.

when app is running go to http://localhost:3000/src/, I didnt setup angular router since was quite busy
with other things, but that is also one thing I would do to make it better.

to start using it just click on card and it will insert card in to card reader and accordingly update screen
follow screen and get your money :)
